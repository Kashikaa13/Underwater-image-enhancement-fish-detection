# Underwater Image Enhancement and Fish Species Detection using CV-GAN

This project focuses on enhancing underwater images and detecting fish species using a custom Conditional GAN (CV-GAN) approach. It incorporates both image enhancement and object detection to improve the accuracy and reliability of underwater fish classification.

---

## 🧠 Methodology Overview

### 📥 1. Dataset Collection
Two major datasets are used:
- **EUVP**: For underwater image enhancement.
- **FISH**: For fish species identification.

---

### 🧹 2. Data Preprocessing
Preprocessing steps include:
- **Class Filtering**
- **Label Remapping**
- **Data Cleaning**

---

### 🎨 3. Image Enhancement Approaches
Three main enhancement techniques are evaluated:
- **Traditional Image Processing**
- **Funie-GAN**
- **Custom GAN (USRGAN)**: Trained on the EUVP dataset for underwater image enhancement.

---

### 🛠️ 4. Custom GAN Training (USRGAN)
- GAN architecture is trained using the EUVP dataset.
- Fine-tuned with domain-specific images for improved visual quality and fish visibility.

---

### 🔍 5. Image Post-Processing
- **CLAHE** (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)
- **Saturation Boost ×2**

---

### 🐟 6. Fish Detection
- Detection performed using **YOLO** (You Only Look Once) object detection framework on enhanced images.
- Evaluation of detection accuracy across different enhancement strategies.

---

### ⚖️ 7. Results Comparison and Evaluation
Two evaluation phases:
1. **Qualitative and quantitative comparison** of enhanced images (using SSIM & PSNR).
2. **Performance comparison of YOLO-based fish detection** across enhancement methods.

---

### 🚀 8. Model Deployment
Final model is deployed with the best-performing enhancement method for real-time fish species detection.

---

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)**
- **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio)**

---

## 🧪 Tools & Frameworks
- Python
- PyTorch/TensorFlow (for GANs)
- OpenCV (image preprocessing)
- YOLO (object detection)
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (visualization)
